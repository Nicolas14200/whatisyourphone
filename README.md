Hello there,

Your goal for this exercice is to fill each user which is in users.json file with a phone number.<br/>

The assignPhoneToUsers function will be responsible to return a new array of users filled with a "phone" property.<br/>
For example :

[
    {
    "id": 87,
    "first_name": "Louise",
    "last_name": "Ramos",
    "email": "lramos2e@mit.edu",
    "country": "Macedonia",
    "modified": "2015-08-14",
    "vip": false,
    "phone": "(242) 0107-2183"
    },
    etc ...
]

For doing this, we provide you the function which will generate phone number. You will have to use it for generate as many phones as they are users. Each user must have a random phone number.
